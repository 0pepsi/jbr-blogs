# About me 
- My name is Jbr Al-Otaibi, and I’m 17 years old.
- I’m highly passionate about exploit development, with a strong focus on kernel exploitation and low-level system internals.
- In my previous work, I’ve hunted bugs for major organizations and reported vulnerabilities in companies like Cisco and MasterCard.
